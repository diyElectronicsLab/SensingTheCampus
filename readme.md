## Preparations

Before we are diving deeper into the world of DIY Electronics and programming, we need to get familiar with our set of tools. Your first exercise is to download our go-to code editor (*Arduino IDE*).

- download and install the software for your machine [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
- get familiar with the interface --> [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX8z3-BEuWQ&list=PLwWF-ICTWmB7-b9bsE3UcQzz-7ipI5tbR&index=2)
- check out what is a microcontroller --> [video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/adding-electronics-to-rapid-prototypes/what-is-a-microcontroller-ixvF0?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_EMEA__coursera_FTCOF_career-academy_pmax-multiple-audiences-country-multi&campaignid=20858198824&adgroupid=&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=x&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=&hide_mobile_promo&gad_source=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjw99e4BhDiARIsAISE7P_s_pTyHS_niVnGHkCF8gyC_9ml_EXtmRzS5yz2NkcuhRP1rhmoQG8aAhpoEALw_wcB)
- have a look at the ESP32 Dev Kit. This is the microcontroller we will be using throughout the seminar (we do not use Arduino this time) --> [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5CB4t9sukM&t=18s)

If you do not understand all the content of the videos yet, it's totally fine. We will touch on that again during our workshop.

--> please bring your laptop and a usb-c cable to our next meeting / workshop.
